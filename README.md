# Deployment Strategies - Headstart

Based on "6 Deployment Strategies explained in Depth" at https://www.plutora.com/blog/deployment-strategies-6-explained-in-depth

For every software development firm, there comes a time when their software will need to be changed or upgraded. It can come in the form of a total version change or fixing a bug found in the original version.

Now that the new version is ready, here comes the real task the firm’s DevOps teams must undertake: How do we deploy this new upgrade seamlessly without complicating issues, bearing in mind that the user experience of the end-users is a top priority?

To solve this humongous task, the DevOps team integrates **deployment strategies** into their operating procedures. Over the years, different techniques have been developed to help software firms successfully deploy new application and code versions. These techniques are called **deployment strategies**.

Here we’ll look at what deployment strategies are and the various types of deployment strategies, and their method of usage. We’ll also cover each technique’s advantages and disadvantages and when to use which deployment strategy in your work as a DevOps engineer.

**What Is a Deployment Strategy?**
A deployment strategy is any technique employed by DevOps teams to successfully launch a new version of the software solution they provide. These techniques cover how network traffic in a production environment is transitioned from the old version to the new version. Based on the firm’s specialty, a deployment strategy can influence downtime and the company’s operational cost.

**Various Types of Deployment Strategies**
Now that we understand what deployment strategies are, let’s explore the various types of deployment strategies.

## 100 - Blue/Green Deployment

See [README.md](./100/README.md)

## 200 - Canary Deployment

See [README.md](./200/README.md)

## 300 - Recreate Deployment

See [README.md](./300/README.md)

## 400 - Ramped Deployment

See [README.md](./400/README.md)

## 500 - Shadow Deployment

See [README.md](./500/README.md)

## 600 - A/B Testing Deployment

See [README.md](./600/README.md)

**Better Deployment with Tools**
Successfully launching new features with any deployment strategy isn’t an easy task. DevOps teams need to understand what values they’ll be shipping to their users. Luckily, Plutora offers tools can make it easier for DevOps teams to launch or release new features with any deployment strategies.

For example, [release management tools](https://www.plutora.com/platform/release-management) allow firms to plan and manage their release, adopting a deployment strategy and tracking analytics. Another tool that’s great to have when planning a deployment is the [deployment planning tool](https://www.plutora.com/platform/deployment-planning). This tool allows a streamlined deployment process to minimize risk.

Software deployment tools save time as they can manage [CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous delivery)](https://www.plutora.com/blog/understanding-ci-cd-pipeline), automating deployment. These tools can also enhance security as they can integrate role-based access control.

**Conclusion**
You can deploy a new version of your software using any of these strategies. Each of these strategies has its merits and demerits, and each is good in different scenarios. The only question now is, what makes the most sense for your DevOps team to use? Keep in mind your team’s, project’s, and company’s needs and business goals. Also, note how much downtime your company can afford and other cost constraints.
