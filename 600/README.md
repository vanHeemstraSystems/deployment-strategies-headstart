# 600 - A/B Testing Deployment

In A/B testing deployment, developers deploy the new version alongside the older version. However, the new version is only available to a subset of users. These users are selected based on specific conditions and parameters the engineers choose. These parameters can be the user’s location, type of device, UI language, and operating system.

This method measures the effectiveness of the application’s new functionality. After gathering statistics from performance monitoring, developers roll out the version that yielded the best results to all users.

Real-time statistical data can help developers make important and favored decisions about their software. However, A/B testing is very complex to set up. It also requires a highly intelligent (and pricey) load balancer.
